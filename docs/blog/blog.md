Welcome to my blog.

# About me

I am a Senior web developer and I use my GitHub to play around with Domain-driven design, Behavior-driven design, dotNET
and some front-end work like this.

By the way I also have Azure DevOps aside from GitHub.

I will take some time every week to improve my website, also the about me page, but if you want to know a bit more about
me, you can read my LinkedIn profile:
