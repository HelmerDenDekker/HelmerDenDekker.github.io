# How to generate architecture diagrams
*8-9-2023*

In this article I will explain how to generate an architectural diagram.  

The [UML language](https://plantuml.com) is used to code the diagrams.
The C4 model is used to structurize the architectural diagrams.

## What is the C4 model?

Aside from being a car manufactured by CitroÃ«n, it is a graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of systems.

- C1 level: (System) Context diagram. It shows the system in scope and relationship with other systems and its users;
- C2 level: Container diagrams. It shows the decomposed system and the relation between its containers. A container represents an application or data store;
- C3 level: Component diagrams. It shows the interrelated components in a container;
- C4 level: Code diagrams;

The C2 level has nothing to do with Docker containers. It is just a term coined by simon Brown to describe something holding components, but not being the system. With a C, because otherwise it won't
The C4 level is highly debated, for its usefullness and for its zoom-level. You can generate code diagrams from your IDE. Simon says: I do not recommend level 4. 

Simon also says: Don't do Simon says, so do not see this as a dogma. These are guidelines for architecture diagrams.

### Zoom level

The first three models are clearly related, and I always see this as a zoom level.

So, from the Context-level on C1, where you see the system and the world in lives in, you zoom into the system going to the C2 container level. Suppose you want to kno more about a certain application, you zoom into level 3, the components level.

## How to generate a C4-model-style diagram

I will take you through how to generate the C4 models, context level, container level and component level, step by step.

### Setup and installation

Step by step installation procedure:

#### Use Visual Studio Code

I generate the C4 models using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I hope you have this IDE installed. As an alternative you can also use the [online server](https://www.plantuml.com/), but that has its limitations.  
![Go to the plantUML online server](/assets/images/c4model/onlineserver.png "Go to the plantUML online server")

I will use VS code throughout this how to.

#### Install Java

The first step is to install JAVA. I had to go through the agony of visiting the plantUML website, sorry guys, but every time I get so nervous of how it looks and behaves. with the picture popping up, every time I go AAAAAARRGH!  
Sorry.  I am calm now.

Install Java (if you do not have it installed already): [Java download link](https://www.java.com/en/download/)  

Please check the license terms.

#### Visual Studio Code Extensions

In VS Code, install the plantUml extension.

![Install extensions in Visual Studio Code](/assets/images/c4model/plantumlext.png "Install extensions in Visual Studio Code")

- Click on Extensions icon
- Type plantuml in the search box
- Click on the install button (I already installed it, should be where the pink box is)

Now you are ready to go!

### Generate an architecture diagram

For most of my repo's I store the architecture diagrams in the ".documentation" folder:
![Documentation folder](/assets/images/c4model/docmap.png "Documentation folder")

This is where I store the plantUml files. For example look at the [WebShopDemo GitHub documentation](https://github.com/HelmerDenDekker/HelmerDemo.WebShop/tree/develop/.documentation).

#### Code the architecture diagram

Coding the diagram is easy.

In the first line you start with "@startuml" to start the uml, in the last line, end it with... @enduml.  
In the second line I include the Context model settings from the plantuml-stdlib.  
In the third line I include the legend.  
In the fifth line I enter a title for this model.

Next you can go crazy with whatever you want. In this example I show:
- Person, with the arguments variableName (this will be the name of the variable, you can use later in the relations)
- System, like Person.
- Rel, which shows the relation between Person and System

```bash
@startuml ModelName
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml
LAYOUT_WITH_LEGEND()

title ModelTitle

Person(variablenameperson, "NamePerson", "Description person")

System(variablenamesystem, "NameSystem", "Description system")

Rel(variablenameperson, variablenamesystem, "Description relation")

@enduml
```

#### Example and generation

You clone [the webshop demo repository](https://github.com/HelmerDenDekker/HelmerDemo.WebShop), and open the C1Context.puml in the .documentation folder. If you click on in with the right mouse button -the one at the right if you did not switch them around-, you will get the menu:
![Menu in Visual Studio Code](/assets/images/c4model/pumlmenu.png "PlantUML menu in Visual Studio Code")

##### Preview

You can preview the context model by clicking preview current diagram.

![Example preview](/assets/images/c4model/example.png "Example preview")

As you can see (I sketched lots of arrows):
- The legend shows at the bottom
- The title shows at the top
- The Customer person shows as a Person icon
- The Webshop system shows as a System icon
- The Account service shows as an external system
- The relation shows as a black arrow with description.

##### Export

You can export the file, next you get to choose the filetype. The file is exported to an out folder by default.

Here is an example of a generated diagram:

![Example context diagram](/assets/images/c4model/webshopcontext.svg "Example context diagram")


## How to generate a C4 model from Visual Studio

Mind this: Simon says: Do not use the C4 model (code = documentation on this level).

How do you generate a C4-diagram?


1. Open the folder of your solution in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
2. Create a folder named .classdiagrams inside this folder.
3. Open the Terminal (VS upper menu, Terminal --> New Terminal) or Package Manager (VSC: upper menu Tools --> Nuget Package Manager --> Package Manager Console)
4. In the terminal window execute.

```bat
puml-gen [local-path-to-repo]\[project] [local-path-to-repo]\[project]\.classdiagramms -dir -excludePaths bin,obj,Properties
```

You can add any folders you want to exclude in the end.  
     
Inside the .classdiagrams folder you will find all the separate class diagrams and a combined class diagram.

## Conclusion

It is that easy. Feel free to look around in my diagrams to see how I created the Containers and Components diagrams: [WebShopDemo GitHub documentation](https://github.com/HelmerDenDekker/HelmerDemo.WebShop/tree/develop/.documentation).
