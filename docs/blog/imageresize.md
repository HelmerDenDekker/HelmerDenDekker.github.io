## *Rapid fire thoughts*

Maui only for embedded resources :-(  

Which packages in 2023?
- System.Drawing
- ImageSharp
- Magick.Net
- SkiaSharp
- MagicScaler

Others:
[Image resizer](https://discoverdot.net/projects/image-resizer)
[ImageProcessor](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor) is dead, and this is a wrapper around system.drawing anyways. Became ImageSharp







## *Outline*

Inspiration:
