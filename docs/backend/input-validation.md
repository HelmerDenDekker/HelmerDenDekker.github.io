## Definition

By definition (as articulated so well by OWASP):
Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from entering or being persisted, mitigating the risk of triggering malfunction of various downstream components. Input validation should happen at any interface receiving input.
