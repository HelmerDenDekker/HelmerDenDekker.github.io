- Problem statement
- Boundary conditions
- Solution


## *Outline*

## Architecture

Just enough upfront.
- requirements overview

## How to design - rules of thumb:

- Keep it simple!
- Loose coupling
- Separate concerns

Furthermore (less important):  
- Keep it flexible
- High cohesion, low coupling
- Information hiding
- Principle of Modularity


## In other words

- Keep the backend (services) stateless.
- Use orchestration for simple apps
- Use Choreography for complex apps
