# How to Benchmark dotnet
*1-12-2023*

Status: Work in progress  

## Getting started

[Follow the getting started guide from Benchmark dotnet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/getting-started.html). I like my code a bit more separated, so in the example code of HelmerAlgorithms I kept the Program apart from the Benchmark class. 

## When to use

For measuring single process only.
Measure improvements on methods.
