- Problem statement

Looking for a way to return a Result from logic. While brainstorming with Tejas, we came up with the idea of a Result object.
This object would contain:
- boolean indicating success
- a code for the parent to decide how to proceed (like an HTTP status code)
- a message, according to the minimum-information-principle, informing the user or developer about the error.
- possibly a value, if the operation was successful.

## The first iteration 2020-2025

Query-command separation.

## The second iteration

Inspired by a geek-out podcast with Nick Chapsas, I realized an enum would probably use less memory than a class.
