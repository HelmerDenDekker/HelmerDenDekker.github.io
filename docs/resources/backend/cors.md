CORS General info:

Browser security prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
This restriction is called the same-origin policy. The same-origin policy prevents a malicious site from reading
sensitive data from another site. Sometimes, you might want to allow other sites to make cross-origin requests to your
app.
