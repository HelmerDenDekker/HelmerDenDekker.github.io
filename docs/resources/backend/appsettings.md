When to use what, for loading appsettings

By Mukesh:   
When to use IOptions, IOptionsMonitor, and IOptionsSnapshot?

- Prefer to use IOptions, when you are not expecting your configuration values to change.
- Use IOptionsSnapshot when you expect your values to change, but want them to be uniform for the entire request cycle.
- Use IOptionsMonitor when you need real-time options data.
