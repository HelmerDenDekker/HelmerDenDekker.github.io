How to test a web app with a small group of people

## *Outline*

## Resources

### Preparation:

1. Define your goals:  What aspects of the app do you want to test? Is it core functionality (sending messages, receiving notifications), usability, or something else? Having clear goals will help you design effective tests.

2. Recruit testers: Choose a small group of people (3-5) who represent your target audience. Consider demographics, technical expertise, and how they might use the app.

3. Prepare the app:  Ensure the app is ready for testing with a clean build and any necessary instructions for testers.

4. Create test cases:  Develop a set of scenarios testers will follow. These should cover core functionalities, different message types (text, images), and edge cases (weak connection, app crash).


### Testing Phase:

1. Introduce the app:  Brief your testers about the app's purpose, features, and  testing goals. Explain the test cases and how to report issues.

2. Moderate the testing:  Be available to answer questions and clarify test cases. Encourage testers to think aloud while using the app and report any bugs or usability problems they encounter.

3. Gather feedback:  Use a survey or conduct interviews after the testing session. Ask testers about their experience,  what they liked/disliked, and suggestions for improvement.

###  Analyze and Report:

1. Compile results:  Document all bugs, usability issues, and feedback from testers. Categorize them based on severity and frequency.

2.  Analyze data:  Identify patterns and recurring issues. See if they align with your testing goals.

3.  Prioritize fixes:  Based on severity and impact, prioritize the bugs and usability issues to be addressed.

4. Report findings:  Create a clear report summarizing the testing process, results, and recommendations for improvement.
