## Intro

> The distinction between [testing and checking](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856) is about the difference between testing itself and one element of it. Checking the output is relatively easy. Evaluating the product to find problems — and determining whether people will want to fix those problems or tolerate them — is much more challenging.

> In testing, we’re trying to shift our notion of the status of the product from untested assumptions to observed facts.
