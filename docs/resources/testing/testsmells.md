### Test smells

Sniff test. Smell will come to you. Symptom, not the root cause. Discover the code smells (don't go look for them)  

Three smell categories:  
- Obscure test code: Cannot understand the test code.
- Behaviour smell: Something strange happens when running the tests
- Project smell: Anything outside of the code scope: Bugs in your (production) code, project management etc.
