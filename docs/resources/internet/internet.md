# Internet
*5-5-2023*

For me it all started with the internet.
I was fiddling with computers since I was young, but lost interest (or became heavily frustrated) since windows 95. I was breathing MS-DOS at the time, and having this heavy interface on top of it... It was like an unclear filter to me.

I regained my interest when I started designing web pages at University. It was both easy and creative, it fitted me like a glove.

 And if you design software applications you should know how the internet works.
