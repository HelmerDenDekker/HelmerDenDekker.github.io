# Meeting Maui

*28-5-2024*

Status: Work in progress  
Type of post: Idea

## *Rapid fire thoughts*

### First thoughts

This is really cool. The idea is great, I love it, I wanna try this.

### Second thoughts

When trying images:
Why!!!! My god, what did I do, why did I look into this.

I was trying some stuff with images, and it felt like Alice in wonderland. This will only work there, that will only work on Android, do not so this on iOS, and so on.

### Third thoughts

I started building some app, inspired by a dotNET zuid talk.

The experience is great, and I love it.
I know it is not perfect, but you can do a lot really quick. You can do hybrid blazor, which is perfect.

Less perfect: I tried coupling my Db with EF to MAUI, which is a stupid idea to start, BUT I was just doing POC and having this old DB, right. Well, it is not even stable. MAUI would crash at any given moment. Which is okay, because it is a stupid idea to couple a database to an application that runs on Windows/iOS/Android.

SO, instead I just used my older idea of using the file system as DB. AI translated some stuff, and it worked like a charm. Really. All problems gone.

Love Copilot, love MAUI.

Except, when I tried unit testing. This was a total disaster. So I had to refactor my code, and move all the helpers into a separate project (library). The tests are running smooth AND MAUI as well. So.

I am a bign fan now.

### Try-sies

I want to try something like mudblazor, because now I just copied some very old (2004-ish) html-code and it looks crap.

I would like to try some more stuff with images later.

Heads-up: Combining Blazor-Hybrid and MAUI - refresh problem. StateHasChanged will not always update the state. Have to look into that.
