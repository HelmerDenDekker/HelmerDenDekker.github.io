# Frontend
*5-5-2023 - updated 17-7-2023*

About the front end of web development. This is the client-side of web-development.

## Languages

I will describe several languages here, like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Javascript. These are languages commonly used in Frontends.

## Frameworks

Frameworks can help you focussing on the functionality you want to create for your users, without having to do heavy lifting or maintenance.

I will write about my experience with some frameworks
- Fat Free Framework (PHP)
- VueJS (TS and JS)
- MVC (ASP.NET)
- Razor (ASP.NET)
- Blazor (-web and -server, dotNET)

## Static site generators

For this site I am using VitePress. VitePress is a static site generator.
