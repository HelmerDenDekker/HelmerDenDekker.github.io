# Frontend

*5-5-2023 - updated 18-4-2025*

About the front end of web development. This is the client-side of web-development.

## Languages

I work with several languages, but mostly:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- C# (MVC, Razor, Blazor)
- Markdown (VitePress)


I also know Mud.Blazor, some MAUI, but I do not use them on a daily basis.
Before 2020 I used PHP a lot. Around 2010 I created my own framework and markdown-like language for a project that got killed in 2024.

## Frameworks

Frameworks can help you to focus on the functionality you want to create for your users, without having to do heavy
lifting or maintenance.

In the repository you can find blogs about my experience with some frameworks:

- Fat Free Framework (PHP)
- VueJS (TS and JS)
- MVC (ASP.NET)
- Razor (ASP.NET)
- Blazor (-web and -server, dotNET)

## Static site generators

For this site I am using VitePress. VitePress is a static site generator.

Another project I did some work for was created using plain JavaScript for the static site.
It loads the content from JSON files generated by a MAUI CMS app.
