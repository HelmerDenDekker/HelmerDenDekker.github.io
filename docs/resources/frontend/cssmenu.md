## Creating a CSS menu

Ever since I discovered CSS to create a menu (in 2004?) I try to create my menus using CSS only, and avoiding JavaScript.  
It is not that I dislike JavaScript, it just makes thing so complex (to code).

I started out with the W3 schools example, and having read many others, I just found them to work with float. And I do not like float.
Also, my design is completely different, and when I implement these, I cannot click them away.

=> Solution? Redesign my site to use flexbox. OR Use Javascript.
